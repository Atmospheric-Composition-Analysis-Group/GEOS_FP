This directory contains scripts to adjust the existing GEOS-FP data files 
as follows:

(1) Files will be renamed from GEOS572*.nc to GEOSFP*.nc

(2) Attributes have been modified for COARDS compliance

(3) Each file now contains only one vertical dimension.  This will facilitate
    the standalone Grid-Independent GEOS-Chem using ESMF/MAPL.  The MAPL
    netCDF read & regrid  routines cannot handle more than one vertical
    dimension per netCDF file.
